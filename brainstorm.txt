Working Checklist (edit it as I think of things that need to be done)

> Styling is messed up for quotes once they're pinned, and also for all the quotes
that are the product of a search

> Touch events so that it works on mobile? Do I need separate event
listeners for touch events?

> Implement more of the color pallette to make it look better

> Animation for snapping to the top of the page when a search is performed

> Use rest syntax to put as many first, middle, and last names into the search
bar as needed

> Accessibility
    > Everything should be accessible via tab and spacebar / enter keys. The
    aria tags should make sense when read off by the screen reader so that a 
    user that can't see the screen can get a pretty good idea of what's on the 
    page

> Clean up code / better comments

|| DONE ||

> Implement JavaScript for when all the searched quotes are appended, so
that the page title and the search bar snap to the top (and the random quote
given upon page load is removed)

> Pinning functionality: when a user clicks on a quote, it should be pinned to
the top, even when a new search is performed the quote should still be there
    > It also needs to be able to be unpinned
    > This could be done with objects and an array, or just with classes

> Figure out how the query thing works for the database that prof gave. I could
mess around with this on my own, but it's probably easier to wait for prof to
post documentation
    > Emailed prof
    > Check out Quotable API that he mimicked
    > Wait for documentation, the easiest way, but it's taking prof some time to 
    post it

> Fix media queries so that it looks when super big on a monitor too

> Use media queries to figure out how large the screen is and adjust elements
accordingly
    > I need some sort of 'threshold' for when the elements should shift
    to a desktop design and vice versa, watch profs videos for this
    > I assume some of this will be done by standard 'width' properties

> Fix JavaScript so that the random quote is inserted within a div
below the search bar
    > Do this before inserting all the quotes that match the search,
    because that is just doing this x number of times (but not at random)
